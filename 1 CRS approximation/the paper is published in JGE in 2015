Abstract
Multiparameter stacking is a crucial tool to get a high-quality time image of the subsurface,
which can provide a basis for many important applications. We analyse the CRS
approximation for a circular reflector embedded into effective anisotropic media. In this
case, the CRS attributes depend on both reflector curvature and anisotropy parameters. We
consider the effective anisotropic model from two anisotropic cases—elliptical isotropic
and transversely isotropic with vertical symmetry axis—and one vertically heterogeneous
isotropic case, i.e. two-layer model. By performing a sensitivity analysis, we show how the
estimates depend on anisotropy parameters. We convert the CRS attributes into parameters for
the isotropic model and analyse these estimates’ behaviour along the seismic line. From this
behaviour, we estimate both structure and anisotropy parameters.
