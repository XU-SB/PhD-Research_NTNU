The moveout approximations play an important role in seismic data processing. The
standard hyperbolic moveout approximation is based on an elliptical background
model with two velocities: vertical and normal moveout. We propose a new set
of moveout approximations based on a perturbation series in terms of anellipticity
parameters using the alternative elliptical background model defined by vertical and
horizontal velocities. We start with a transversely isotropic medium with a vertical
symmetry axis. Then, we extend this approach to a homogeneous orthorhombic
medium. To define the perturbation coefficients for a new background, we solve the
eikonal equation with horizontal velocities in transversely isotropic medium with a
vertical symmetry axis and orthorhombic media. To stabilise the perturbation series
and improve the accuracy, the Shanks transform is applied for all the cases. We
select different parameterisations for both velocities and anellipticity parameters for
an orthorhombic model. From the comparison in traveltime error, the new moveout
approximations result in better accuracy comparing with the standard perturbationbased
methods and other approximations.
