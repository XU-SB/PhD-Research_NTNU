The importance of diving waves is being realized because
they provide long-wavelength model information, which can
be used to help invert for the reflection information in fullwaveform
inversion. The factorized model is defined here
as a combination of vertical heterogeneity and constant
anisotropy, and it admits closed-form description of the traveltime.
We have used these resulting analytical formulas to
describe the behavior of diving waves in a factorized anisotropic
medium, and we used an approximate imaging moveout
formulation (residual moveout after imaging) to update
the velocity model when the wrong model parameters (isotropic
assumption) were used for imaging. We then used
these analytical representations of the image moveout to establish
a semblance analysis framework to search for the optimal
anisotropic parameters. We have also discussed
different parameterizations of the factorized medium to find
the one that gave the best accuracy in anisotropy parameters
estimation.
