We have defined a group of new parameterizations for
P-wave in acoustic orthorhombic (ORT) media with three
cross-term normal moveout velocities and three cross-term
anellipticity parameters. The corresponding perturbationbased
approximations for traveltime in ORT model are developed
using the new parameterizations. The perturbation
coefficients are computed by solving the eikonal equation in
corresponding parameterization. Eight types of parameterization
are defined based on the different elliptical background
model and selection of anellipticity parameters. As
the traveltime can be converted from the group velocity inverse,
the sensitivity of the group velocity inverse to anellipticity
parameters is analyzed for different parameterizations
and different range of offsets. To stabilize the perturbation
series and improve the accuracy, the Shanks transform is applied.
From the comparison of traveltime after the Shanks
transform using different parameterizations, we have concluded
that the parameterization with vertical, two horizontal
velocities, and three cross-term anellipticity parameters results
in the best accuracy of traveltime function for P-wave
in acoustic ORT medium.
